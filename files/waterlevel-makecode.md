## Step 1: Connect the Water Level Sensor to the Breakout Board

The breakout boards provided for this presentation may differ from the one presented below. The breakout boards from DFRobot have a green pin instead of a yellow pin for the GPIO. Nevertheless, the functionality is the same for this demonstration as the order is still SVG.

Connect the water level sensor to pin 1 on the breakout board. The black pin (GND) should be connected to the black wire.
